# OpenCode

## Welcome to OpenCode

This is a general repository to upload some useful small Python scripts. 
It is open to anyone, so you can easily upload your own if you think someone might find them useful.

## There are a few rules to follow

1. No harmful code: Files with harmful code will be immediately denied
2. No code spamming: If your pull-request doesnt get accepted, please don't spam the code, it doesn't help.
3. Be respectful at all time
4. Follow Github rules and guidelines
5. Python3 only!
6. For everything else I forgot to say, please use common sense

### Here is a tutorial to help you: [create pull-requests properly](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-contribute-to-a-github-repository-project-78f777623f18)

### Have fun!
